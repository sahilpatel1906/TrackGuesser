                      <b>Starting:</b>
                      <ul class="list-decimal">
                        <li>Select a playlist or provide your own Spotify public playlist URL</li>
                        <li>Select a difficulty option, easy (Hear a whole 30s), normal (Hear more for each guess), or hard (Hear JUST 5s)</li>
                        <li>The game will select 5 random tracks from the playlist to be quizzed upon</li>
                      </ul>
                      <b>Playing:</b>
                      <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>You start the round with 1000 points, upon guessing correctly you will add those points to your <b>score</b></li>
                        <li>Listen to the song!</li>
                        <li>Depending on your difficulity, you'll have a different length of the preview to hear</li>
                        <li>Once you've listened, you have the ability to guess the artist of the track to earn bonus points. You only get 1 guess</li>
                        <li>After guessing the artist, you then are tasked with putting in what you think the song title is.</li>
                        <li>The Album Hint will reveal album name and art, at the cost of 100 points</li>
                        <li>The Artist Hint will reveal the artists for the track, at the cost of 200 points. If you've guessed the artist correctly, you can't use this hint!</li>
                        <li>The Track Hint will reveal the first letter of the track title, at the cost of 100 points.</li>
                        <li>Each incorrect song guess OR skip will deduct 100 points. You have a maximum of 6 guesses before "flunking out" and moving on to the next round, earning 0 points</li>
                        <li>The maxmimum score is 5,500 points, strive for the leaderboards!</li>
